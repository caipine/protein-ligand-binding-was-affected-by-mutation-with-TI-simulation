#  Protein Mutaion caused Drug Resistance

to analyze protein drug binding with Thermodynamic Integration (TI) simulations 

This is the script to run TI simulation with AMBER18 pmemd.cuda GPU for sideâ€“chain mutations or more generally for transformations that involve covalent bonds to a transformed group. 

I will investigate here what happens to binding to anti tumor drug Gefitinib in EGFR (PDB ID 181L) when wild EGFR was mutated T790 to M790 which happened in certain patient after a wile with Gefitinib treatment. I hypothesize that mutating this residue to Methionine will have a destabilising effect due to steric clashes.

The analysis script suggests that the Threonine 790 is favoured over the Methionine mutant by about 5 kcal/mol.
